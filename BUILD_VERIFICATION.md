# Build Verification Guide

This workflow handles everything automatically! No manual Azure configuration needed.

## ✅ How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions builds your app** (not Azure)
2. **Creates static files** in the `out/` directory
3. **Uploads pre-built files** to Azure
4. **Azure just serves the files** (no building required)

## 📋 What You Need to Upload to GitHub

Make sure these files are in your GitHub repository root:

```
your-repo/
├── package.json                     ← Required for npm install
├── next.config.js                   ← With export: 'export'
├── staticwebapp.config.json         ← Azure routing rules
├── .github/workflows/               ← Deployment automation
│   └── azure-static-web-apps-deploy.yml
├── app/                             ← Your Next.js pages
├── components/                      ← React components
└── ...                              ← Other frontend files
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables in GitHub

Set this in your GitHub repository:
- **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **Variables**
- Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` = `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:5000`

## 🚀 Deployment Process

1. **Push to GitHub** → Automatic deployment starts
2. **GitHub builds** → Creates static files
3. **Azure deploys** → Serves the built files
4. **No manual Azure settings needed!** ✨

## 🔍 If Build Fails

Check the GitHub Actions tab in your repository for build logs and errors.

## 📝 Test Locally

Before pushing, test the build:
```bash
cd frontend-for-github
npm install
npm run build
# Should create 'out/' directory with static files
```
